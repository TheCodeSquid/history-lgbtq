    # Anti-LGBTQ+ Legislation
    
    There has been a dramatic increase in the number of laws being proposed with the purpose of encroaching upon the
    freedoms of LGBTQ+ individuals.
    
    Examples include the notorious ["Don't Say Gay" bill passed in Florida](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2022/1557),
    which prohibits the "instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity" to students in grades K-3
    or "in a manner that is not appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with standards".
    
    Although not overtly harmful, the vagueness of the quoted terms leave the scope of the bill up to interpretation.
    This could ultimately harm LGBTQ+ students by providing the legal means for LGBTQ+ topics to be deemed unappropriate
    for all ages and banned from classrooms.

    of anti-LGBTQ+ bills and their progress across the US.
    
    Most are rejected, but a few end up implemented (or are still in the review process).
